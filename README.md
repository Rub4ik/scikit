**End-to-End Heart Disease Classification**
=============================================

**Overview**
------------

This project is a comprehensive example of an end-to-end machine learning workflow for classifying heart disease using structured data. The project uses a dataset from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation.

**Dataset**
------------

The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Clinic Foundation's heart disease dataset, which contains 303 rows and 14 columns. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, and blood pressure, as well as a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

The project is structured as follows:

* `Predicting.ipynb`: This is the main notebook that contains the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
* `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
* `models/`: This directory contains the trained models used in the project.
